    "\n",
    "Before running the notebook, ensure that the pygeoapi service is running. On the OSGeoLive Application Menu go to `Geospatial > Web Services > pygeoapi > Start pygeoapi`. Then check in a browser that the pygeoapi homepage is running at http://localhost:5000/.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by importing `owslib` and checking its version. This notebook has been tested with version `0.33.0`.\n",
    "As the new OGC APIs return JSON rather than XML (as with the older WxS services such as WFS) we will also import the the standard Python [json](https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/json.html) library to easily print and access data in JSON structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reading the OGC Features API can be easily done using the [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) library (which OWSLib uses underneath), but using OWSLib helps with building more complex URLs, such as using [CQL](https://portal.ogc.org/files/96288) queries, adding and deleting features, handling authentication, and logging.
